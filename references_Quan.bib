abstract = {In order to eliminate the local CO2 emissions from vehicles and to combat the associated climate change, the classic internal combustion engine can be replaced by an electric motor. The two most advantageous variants for the necessary electrical energy storage in the vehicle are currently the purely electrochemical storage in batteries and the chemical storage in hydrogen with subsequent conversion into electrical energy by means of a fuel cell stack. The two variants can also be combined in a battery electric vehicle with a fuel cell range extender, so that the vehicle can be refuelled either purely electrically or using hydrogen. The air compressor, a key component of a PEM fuel cell system, can be operated at different air excess and pressure ratios, which influence the stack as well as the system efficiency. To asses the steady state behaviour of a PEM fuel cell range extender system, a system test bench utilising a commercially available 30 kW stack (96 cells, 409 cm2 cell area) was developed. The influences of the operating parameters (air excess ratio 1.3 to 1.7, stack temperature 20 °C–60 °C, air compressor pressure ratio up to 1.67, load point 122 mA/cm2 to 978 mA/cm2) on the fuel cell stack voltage level (constant ambient relative humidity of 45%) and the corresponding system efficiency were measured by utilising current, voltage, mass flow, temperature and pressure sensors. A fuel cell stack model was presented, which correlates closely with the experimental data (0.861% relative error). The air supply components were modelled utilising a surface fit. Subsequently, the system efficiency of the validated model was optimised by varying the air mass flow and air pressure. It is shown that higher air pressures and lower air excess ratios increase the system efficiency at high loads. The maximum achieved system efficiency is 55.21% at the lowest continuous load point and 43.74% at the highest continuous load point. Future work can utilise the test bench or the validated model for component design studies to further improve the system efficiency.}

abstract = {Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) is a promising energy source in the future of the transportation sector for powering automobiles instead of Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs). This undoubtedly related to its friendly environmental characteristics and its higher efficiency than the IC Engines. However, there are still challenges that prevent its implementation on a wide scale in which one of these challenges is the thermal management problem of the PEMFCs cooling systems. This article introduces a detailed and comprehensive literature survey of the liquid cooling techniques in the PEMFC stacks, including operation principles and heat generation and removal characteristics. Liquid cooling has been generally and efficiently utilized in the high power PEMFC stacks (>10 kW), enabling the PEMFC to be applied in the transportation sector. In this regard, the previous literature related to the liquid-cooling optimization in PEMFC stacks, including various types of coolant flow field configurations and coolant channels geometries of PEMFC, is summarized. Considering the PEMFCs cooling systems criterion (such as uniform temperature, pressure drop, maximum temperature, heat transfer efficiency, and fuel cell (FC) performance, etc.). The efforts to maintain the low conductivity coolants and using the nanofluids based cooling system as recent alternative coolants in PEMFCs were also included. Further, the cooling loop of the automotive PEMFCs were comparatively reported.}
